\section{Summary}
I am a Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience spanning software development, DevOps, distributed systems, and security. I have worked with large enterprises and startups across multiple geographies. My expertise includes developing high-performance distributed applications, REST APIs, system design, automation, observability, and cloud-native development with Spring Boot and Kubernetes.
